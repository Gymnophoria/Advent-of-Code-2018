# Advent of Code 2018

My solutions to the neat [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) event in ~~both JavaScript and Java (because I know JS well but I'm learning Java in school)~~ JavaScript ~~because I'm too damn lazy to figure out how the heck to do this stuff in Java when I can barely do it in JS, lol~~.

Use it for reference, complain, I dunno. This event is/was quite fun, and made me realize how little I truly know (as of Christmas 2018) about coding; these days take a *long* time for me. This used to say "I'll probably have the activities completed within the hour," but now I realize that's probably not happening.
