# Advent of Code 2018

My solutions to the neat [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) event in ~~both JavaScript and Java (because I know JS well but I'm learning Java in school)~~ JavaScript ~~because I'm too damn lazy to figure out how the heck to do this stuff in Java when I can barely do it in JS, lol~~.

Use it for reference, complain, I dunno, it'll probably have solutions within the hour (but oftentimes not, lol) because I like this event.
